# Build on top of the DutchX
This project is a series of examples on how to build applications on top of the
DutchX.

All the guides, and reference documentation can be found in:
* [http://dutchx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](http://dutchx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Start from the begining
So the examples are part of a guide and you are suppouse to do them in order.

So the first one should be [Example 01: Build on top of the DX](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-example-build-on-top-of-dutchx/tree/master/01_build-of-top-of-dx)

The complete list of examples is:
* [Example 01: Build on top of the DX](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-example-build-on-top-of-dutchx/tree/master/01_build-of-top-of-dx): 
Shows how to create a new project from scratch that depends on DutchX and
how you can **deploy the contracts** in a `ganache-cli` local node.
* [Example 02: Setup the project](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-example-build-on-top-of-dutchx/tree/master/02_setup-the-project): 
(`TODO`) This example shows how to add new migrations to deploy your own 
contracts, and how to **setup the DutchX**. For example for listing your own token 
pair.
* [Example 03: Invoke the DutchX logic](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-example-build-on-top-of-dutchx/tree/master/03_invoke-the-dutchx-logic):
(`TODO`) This example shows how you can use the DutchX contracts, for example to
 get some information from the contract and to **participate in an auction as a buyer**.
