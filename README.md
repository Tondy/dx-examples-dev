# Build on top of the DutchX
This project is a series of examples on how to build applications on top of the
DutchX.

All the guides, and reference documentation can be found in:
* [http://dutchx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](http://dutchx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Start from the begining
So the examples are part of a guide and you are suppouse to do them in order.

So the first one should be [Example 01: Build on top of the DX](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-dev/tree/master/01_build-of-top-of-dx)

The complete list of examples is:
* [Example 01: Build on top of the DX](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-dev/tree/master/01_build-of-top-of-dx):
  * Shows how to create a new project from scratch that depends on DutchX and 
    how you can **deploy the contracts** in a `ganache-cli` local node.
* [Example 02: Use DutchX as an Oracle](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-dev/tree/master/02_use-dx-as-an-oracle): 
  * This example shows how to create your own contract and migrations that makes 
    use the DutchX.
  * In this example we will create a `Safe` contract to deposit fund. We will
    use the DutchX to help us estimate the price in `USD` for any token in our 
`Safe`.
* [Example 03: List your own token pair](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-dev/tree/master/03_list_your_own_toke_pair):
(`TODO`) This example shows how to add new migrations to deploy your own 
contracts, and how to **setup the DutchX**. For example for listing your own token 
pair.
* [Example 04: Invoke the DutchX logic](https://github.com/gnosis/dx-examples-dev/tree/master/04_invoke-the-dutchx-logic):
(`TODO`) This example shows how you can use the DutchX contracts, for example to
 get some information from the contract and to **participate in an auction as a buyer**.
